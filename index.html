    <h3 class="start"><b>Summary</b></h3>
    <p align="justify">Regular exercise is one of the best things you
        can do for your health. It has many benefits, including
        improving your overall health and fitness, and reducing
        your risk for many chronic diseases. There are many
        different types of exercise; it is important that you pick
        the right types for you. Most people benefit from a combination
        of them:</p>


    <ul>
        <li><b>Endurance, or aerobic</b></li>
        <p>activities increase your breathing and heart rate. They keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory system
            healthy
            and improve your overall fitness. Examples include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, and biking.</p>
        <li><b>Strength, or resistance training,</b></li>
        <p> exercises make your muscles stronger. Some examples are lifting weights and using a resistance band.</p>
        <li><b>Balance</b></li>
        <p> exercises can make it easier to walk on uneven surfaces and help prevent falls. To improve your balance, try
            tai
            chi or exercises like standing on one leg.</p>
        <li><b>Flexibility </b></li>
        <p>exercises stretch your muscles and can help your body stay limber. Yoga and doing various stretches can make
            you
            more flexible.</p>

    <h3 class="imp"><b>Importance of Eating Healthy</b></h3>
    <p>A healthy diet is important for good health and nutrition. It is essential to protect you against many chronic
        non-communicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. The nutrients in the foods that you eat
        support the activities of day-to-day living, protect your cells from environmental damage and repair any
        cellular
        damage that might occur.</br></p>
    <p>


        Supporting your gut health with the right healthy diet and lifestyle is of paramount importance because the gut
        plays a key role in your digestion and metabolism. Its primary function is the digestion and absorption of
        nutrients, and the excretion of waste. However, 90% of the serotonin in your body also happens to be produced in
        the
        gut.</br></p>
    <p>

        Serotonin is a chemical that carries messages between nerve cells in the brain and throughout your body. It
        plays a
        key role in such body functions as mood, sleep, digestion, nausea, wound healing, bone health, blood clotting
        and
        sexual desire. An unbalanced, unhealthy diet can impair your gut health and impact both your physical and mental
        wellbeing.<br></p>
    <p>It is also important to educate children at an early age about eating healthy foods. Eating healthily helps a
        child to develop both physically and mentally, to maintain their concentration and energy levels, and this helps
        a
        child to effectively learn throughout the school day. Instilling healthy eating at a young age forms life-long
        healthy
        eating habits and preferences</p>

    <h3>The Importance of teaching healthy habits for children</h3>
    <p id="teach">Introducing healthy habits early on is crucial to your child’s long-term well-being. Children who eat well, get
        enough sleep, and engage in regular physical activity are resilient and self-confident. They are in tune with
        their physical and mental needs.

        Adopting healthy physical habits like consuming balanced meals and getting exercise also prevents chronic
        diseases. Children who develop healthy habits at a young age are more likely to make healthy choices when
        they’re older, preventing them from becoming obese or ill. In addition, health-conscious children are more
        likely to develop high self-esteem and a positive body image.

        Healthy children are also more focused and concentrated, improving academic performance and setting the scene
        for a successful professional life
